date challenge

This challenge seemed odd to me in that it was a hash challenge but adding a personlized hash made the code, in my opinion, 'codesmelly'. I could have created a hash that took the '.wday' that is innately in the 'Date' class and paired those keys with the necessary 2 letter abbreviations. but that would just add more operations to the method itself and the 'Date' class has inherent methods and hashes that are doing the whole job for us. so to clean up the code and make the necessary operations minimal I produced the method that you see here. I hope it works for you!!!
